# Roadmap

This is early development version. I am currently considering:

- [x] Main `Show Graph` command.
- [x] Setting for choosing column for opening files.
- [x] Support for Zettlr-style ID-based links.
- [x] Highlighting of focused file.
- [ ] Automated tests.
- [ ] Dark theme support (+ auto detecting system's dark/light mode).
- [ ] Zoom controls (`+` / `-` / `reset`).
- [ ] Handling external URLs.
- [ ] Ignoring files or directories.
- [ ] Some directory controls within the graph view (adding, removing files).
- [ ] Configurable simulation.
- [ ] Optional display of edge directions.
- [ ] Better examples.
- [ ] Optional autostart.
